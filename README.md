# slack-daily

It's a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was initially
generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be deployed
on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

When activated it starts a virtual daily meeting, calling one by one the members
of the team to tell the others what they have done, what they'll work next and
if there's something preventing them from reaching the team's goal.

It can be activated by sending `daily time` or making a get request to its
`/hubot/daily` endpoint and the daily will start at the `daily-review` channel.

### Running slack-daily Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start slack-daily locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

### Configuration

The bot runs out of the box with default configurations of the box, but you can
set some environment variables to customize it:

- `HUBOT_WAKE_UP` command to start a daily (defaults to `daily-time`)
- `HUBOT_WAKE_UP_PATH` path to start a daily (defaults to `/hubot/daily`)
- `HUBOT_NEXT` message when you're done, call next member (defaults to `next`)
- `HUBOT_SKIP` regex of the message to skip member (defaults to `skip (.+)`)
- `HUBOT_DAILY_CHANNEL_NAME` daily channel (defaults to `daily-review`)
- `HUBOT_DAILY_USERS_BLACKLIST` comma separated users to ignore (defaults to `slackbot,dailyfreak`)

## Deployment

The Heroku app is already configured to listen for pushes to this repo's master
branch and deploy a new version if anybody commits to it.

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if
you're having issues.
